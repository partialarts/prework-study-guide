# Web Development Bootcamp - Prework Study Guide

## Description

- I wanted to learn the foundations of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript by working on a project in readiness for my front-end coding bootcamp
- This project has helped cement the foundations of these topics and given me real world practice with the tools and languages involved.
- The project was created to help other students going through the bootcamp, providing a resource to come back to and to help catalogue an overwhelming amount of content for future reading.
- I learned the basics of the languages described above, how to format my code, test my code and debug it in the browser console when it's not working. I also learned to commit changes using Git for version control.

## Usage

When opening index.html in a browser, each section contains notes about the various topics, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. When the browser DevTools console is opened by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), this will show the JavaScript running. It will list the topics learned from prework and choose a topic at random to study first.
